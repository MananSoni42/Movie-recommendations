# Movie Recommendations
* This is a basic movie recommendation engine. 
* It uses item-item collaborative filtering 

For ease of use, I wrote a simple web wrapper so that anybody can test the system out. [Have a look](http://movie42-app.herokuapp.com/)

## Usage
You can search for movies using the search bar at the top
There are 3 buttons:
* Recommend - Recommends movies to you based on your ratings (Needs atleast 5 ratings for recommendations)
* My movies - Lists the movies that you have rated
* Clear - Clears all ratings so that you can start fresh
